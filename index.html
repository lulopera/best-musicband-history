		<h1>K-POP BANDS AND WHY THEY ARE BETTER</h1>

			<h2>WHAT IS K-POP</h2>
			<article>
				<p>KPOP is a genre of popular music originating in South Korea. It is influenced by styles and genres from around the world, such as experimental, rock, jazz, gospel, hip hop, R&B, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots.</p>

				<p>The more modern form of the genre emerged with the formation of one of the earliest K-pop groups, Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene.</p>

				<p>The term "K-pop" became popular since the 2000s. Previously, South Korean pop music was called Gayo. While "K-pop" is a general term for popular music in South Korea, it is often used in a narrower sense for the genre described here. In 2018, K-pop experienced significant growth and became a 'power player', marking a 17.9% increase in revenue growth.</p>

				<h2>WHY IS KPOP BETTER? ITS FAR SUPERIOR</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>Songwriting:</li>
					<p> it all begins with a diverse, talented set of fearless, global songwriters, from jazz guitarist Andreas Oberg (Red Velvet, Oh My Girl) to Skrillex (4minute), to tons of home grown talent. look at the roster on any album and you’ll see not one or two writers, but often 10 or more, frequently 3 or 4 collaborating on a single track. that’s how you innovate pop music. its no longer just one gal or guy, slamming out chords in the basement.</p>

					<li>Production</li>
					<p>The audio engineering and production far exceeds anything you’ll hear in american pop, particularly in the last four years. They are killing the mixdown and mastering process. Great production brings out the unique timbre, tonality, and voice of each singer. The clarity in a kpop song makes american production sound like a demo tape.</p>

					<li>Talent</li>
					<p> Almost without exception, band members typically spend 10 years or more perfecting their craft even before debut, and that’s 10 years of Korean style hard work. Its not like american pop where you pick up a guitar, practice your scales and arpeggios for 3 months, then cut an album.</p>

					<li>Choreo</li>
					<p> Like the songwriters, kpop production houses bring in choreographers from all over the world, and they are given a lot of leeway to be creative. Its obvious in the sheer diversity of dance styles and unique moves.</p>

					<li>Emphasis on the group</li>
					<p>There are very few solo kpop artists. A kpop band typically has 3 or 4 great singers, each with their own unique voice. they’ll trade lines in a single verse. So we get to hear an endless range of singers and styles.</p>

    <h1>Best Music Band in History</h1>
     <h2>Maria's Opinion</h2>

    <p>In my opinion, the british rock band are the best in the History of music. British rock bands are the best in history because their musicians were able to interpret the feelings and ideologies of young people in the early 60s and transformed blues and jazz into something that new generations felt more identified with. </p>

                <h2>British Bands</h2>

    		<ul>
    			<li>The Beatles</li>

                <p>The Beatles were the beginning of the era of rock in Europe, and with their own style, they infected the whole world with the new music that was taking over the radio stations.</p>

    			<li>Pink Floyd</li>

                <p>Pink Floyd gave to the music the essence of improvisation and avant-garde. They broke paradigms and created a more dramatic and elaborate rock. Pink floyd were not afraid in experimenting wih new sounds and harmonies, in order to obtain a very special ambience in their concerts.</p>
