    <h1>Luz Opinion </h1>

    <p>British rock bands are good, but I believe the best are the new ones. Bands like Muse, Radiohead, Keane, use more technology, and their concerts are much more creative and touch more people than the old ones.</p>

                <li>The millenials: Muse</li>

                <p>With a very clever and stilish manner, Muse were able to combine the spirit of the old glorious bands from the sixties, with the new sounds of the twenty first century.</p>

                <li>The New Generation: Keane</li>

                <p>The vocals, and the lyrics of Keane, makes this band one of a kind in the array of bands existing around the world, Tom Chaplin's voice is unique, and has been compared with Freddy Mercury.</p>
