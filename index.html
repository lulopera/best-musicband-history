    <h1>Maria's Opinion</h1>

    <p>In my opinion, the british rock band are the best in the History of music. British rock bands are the best in history because their musicians were able to interpret the feelings and ideologies of young people in the early 60s and transformed blues and jazz into something that new generations felt more identified with. </p>

    			<li>Pink Floyd</li>

                <p>Pink Floyd gave to the music the essence of improvisation and avant-garde. They broke paradigms and created a more dramatic and elaborate rock. Pink floyd were not afraid in experimenting wih new sounds and harmonies, in order to obtain a very special ambience in their concerts.</p>
